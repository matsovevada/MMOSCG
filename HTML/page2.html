                <p>The player can create their own character using our avatar-builder. With a wide array of options, the
                    character is fully customizable. The player can choose an avatar similar to themselves - or
                    something totally different. <br> In our world the player is free to be whomever they want!

                <h2>Join our village!</h2>
                <p> The villagers of Qara are in need of help. They struggle with literacy and the player needsto help
                    them through a wide range of challenges. Literacy is a crucial part of everyday life and its
                    integral for personal development. The game aims to both highlight the importance of literacy and
                    develop the skills of the player. <br> <br>
                    As with most things in life, the experience is better when shared. The player will meet different
                    characters in game and is tasked with helping them with their issues. With focus on the empowerment
                    of others the player is challenged to solve increasingly more difficult tasks using their literacy
                    skills. Either itÂ´s helping the baker with his recipe or the farmer harvesting crops the player is
                    sure to be challenged in a fun way.</p>
