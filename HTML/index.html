                Qara is a new and exciting learning game for iOS and Android. The app aims to serve as a learning
                supplement
                for Syrian children. In the village of Qara the player is tasked with helping the villagers using their
                reading and writing skills. The tasks get increasingly more difficult as the player develops their
                literacy
                along with the progression of the game. <br> <br>
                Our main focus in the development of Qara is giving the player a stress-free environment where they can
                develop their skills in their own tempo. The tasks are focused around empathy and are mainly
                non-competitive. <br> <br>
                The player is guided by “Lizzie” - our very own literate lizard! Lizzie is equipped with “the Kitab”, a
                book
                that keeps track of previous learning. If the player is stuck on a task they can consult Lizzie by
                either
                looking at previous challenges or ask for hints. Lizzie will keep track of the players development and
                offer
                encouragement when needed. <br> <br>
