            <p class="paragraph">The purpose of Qara is to improve children's skills in regards to literacy and reading ability. Children
                will be
                solving puzzles relating to language, vocabulary and text comprehension. In order to raise these skills,
                we are making a game
                which will be relaxing, educational and entertaining.</p><br>
            <p class="paragraph2">As mentioned in the <a href="page2.html">"Plot and characters page"</a>, the setting of this game is to help a
                village with learning to read. So an example
                of gameplay will be "Word Search", in which the child will be tasked to find several words relating to a
                situation, or a topic. E.G. the town baker in the game world will need help to restore a recipe, and the
                player will have to find ingredient words within a jumbled mess of letters.</p>

                    <p>Another example of a task is "Connect the word", where the player will be given a list of words, and has
                        to connect matching words, opposite words,
                        any kind of pairing of words that might be relevant to what the player is supposed to learn from the
                        task. </p>

                <p>As the effects of living under long term stress can lead to learning disabilities and impede brain
                    development, we believe it
                    important to help the children relax, and have fun, while also developing reading and writing ability.
                    The game aims to encourage
                    children to learn through challenges and rewards, engaging tasks and fun and interactive gameplay.</p>
